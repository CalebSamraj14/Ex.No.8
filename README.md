# Experiment 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation

**Name: CALEBSAMRAJ D**  
**Reg. No.: 212222060030**

---

## Aim
To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image by crafting precise prompts.  
The goal is to identify key elements within the image and use these details to generate an image as close as possible to the original.

---

## Tools Used
- **DALL·E (OpenAI)** – Text-to-image generation tool.  
- **Stable Diffusion** – Open-source text-to-image model.  
- **MidJourney** – AI tool for creative and artistic image generation.  

---

##  Procedure

1. **Analyze the Image**
   - Observed the original image to note important features such as objects, colors, lighting, background, and style.

2. **Create a Basic Prompt**
   - Wrote a simple textual description of the main scene.

3. **Refine the Prompt**
   - Added details about color, texture, lighting, mood, and artistic style.

4. **Generate the Image**
   - Used a text-to-image AI tool (DALL·E) to produce the image.

5. **Compare and Improve**
   - Compared the generated output with the original and refined the prompt if needed.

##  Image 1 – Girl Sitting on a Park Bench

###  Original Image
*(Attach the given original image here)*  
A young woman sitting peacefully on a wooden park bench beneath a large oak tree in autumn.

---

### Prompt Development

#### **Basic Prompt**
> A girl sitting on a park bench under a tree.

#### **Refined Prompt**
> A realistic image of a young woman sitting on a wooden park bench under a large oak tree during autumn. Golden leaves scattered on the ground, warm sunlight filtering through the branches, calm and serene mood.

#### **Final Prompt Used**
> Realistic digital artwork of a young woman sitting on a park bench beneath a tall oak tree with golden autumn leaves. Sunlight rays filtering through branches, warm soft light, natural background, peaceful mood, ultra-detailed, high resolution.

### 🔍 Comparison Report

| **Aspect** | **Original** | **Generated** | **Observation** |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Objects** | Girl, tree, bench | Girl, tree, bench | All main elements present |
| **Colors** | Warm golden tones | Slightly brighter tones | Minor color variation |
| **Lighting** | Natural sunlight | Soft diffused light | Close match |
| **Composition** | Center-focused | Slightly shifted focus | Acceptable |
| **Style** | Realistic | Realistic | Well reproduced |

---

### ✅ Result
The generated image closely matches the original, with only minor variations in color and lighting.  
The composition, tone, and realism were successfully maintained through careful prompt refinement.


##  Example 2: Snowy Mountain Landscape

### Original Image
*(Sample reference image description)*  
A snow-covered mountain range surrounded by tall pine trees beneath a bright blue sky.

---

###  Prompt Development

#### **Basic Prompt**
> A snowy mountain with pine trees and a clear blue sky.

#### **Refined Prompt**
> A peaceful snowy mountain landscape, surrounded by tall pine trees under a clear blue sky. The sunlight reflects off the snow-covered peaks with soft shadows and a calm winter atmosphere.

#### **Final Prompt Used**
> Ultra-realistic photograph of a snow-covered mountain range with tall evergreen pine trees in the foreground, bright blue sky, sunlight glinting off the snow, crisp winter air, detailed textures, and natural lighting.

## 🔍 Comparison Report

| **Feature** | **Original Image** | **Generated Image** | **Remarks** |
|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Objects** | Mountains, snow, trees | Mountains, snow, trees | All elements present |
| **Colors** | White, blue, green | White, blue, green | Matches closely |
| **Lighting** | Natural daylight | Slightly brighter | Acceptable difference |
| **Style** | Realistic photo | Realistic rendering | High similarity |
| **Composition** | Wide-angle view | Similar perspective | Very close match |

---

##  Conclusion
By carefully crafting detailed prompts, the generated image closely resembled the original snowy mountain landscape.  
Minor variations in lighting and tone were observed, but the main composition and color balance were successfully replicated.  
This experiment highlights the importance of **prompt precision** in achieving realistic and accurate AI-generated images.
